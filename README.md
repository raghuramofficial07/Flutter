Welcome to my **Flutter Development** repository! This project represents the **apps I’ve developed** while learning **Flutter** and **Dart** through various **Udemy courses**. I’ve created **cross-platform mobile apps** that run on both **iOS** and **Android**, gaining hands-on experience with Flutter's unique features and capabilities.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- **Firebase**
- **Provider / Riverpod** (State Management)
- **Dart's HTTP Package** (Networking)

## 🎓 Learning Path
The apps in this repository are the result of my dedication to learning Flutter through comprehensive **Udemy courses**. These courses guided me step-by-step through Flutter’s powerful framework, helping me understand both basic and advanced topics like UI design, state management, and backend integrations.

## 📚 Key Skills Learned
- **Dart Programming**: Mastered the syntax and object-oriented programming principles of Dart.
- **Flutter Widgets**: Built apps using Flutter's widget-based structure to create UIs for both iOS and Android.
- **State Management**: Gained expertise in managing app state with Flutter’s built-in tools and third-party libraries like **Provider** and **Riverpod**.
- **Networking & API Integration**: Learned how to communicate with external APIs to fetch and send data in Flutter.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Developed apps that work seamlessly on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.
- **UI/UX Design**: Focused on creating adaptive, responsive, and visually appealing UIs using Flutter’s rich set of customizable widgets.

## 🚀 My Flutter Development Journey
Every app in this repository represents a unique learning experience that helped me master the fundamentals of Flutter development. I built each app while following Udemy courses and challenges, gradually implementing more advanced features like **Firebase integration**, **state management**, and **animation**.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside This Repository
This repo contains the complete source code for all the Flutter apps I’ve built during my learning process:

- **Complete Source Code** for each app built in Flutter.
- **README Documentation** for each app with details about features and implementation techniques.
- **Screenshots & Demo** to show the app’s functionality and UI.
- **Code Snippets** demonstrating how to solve common Flutter challenges.

## 🌱 Future Goals
